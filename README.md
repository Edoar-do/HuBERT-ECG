# ECG-pretraining
Deep Learning project that aims at building a robust pre-trained model in a self-supervised fashion with transferable capabilities when dealing with 12-lead ECGs interpretation.

## Data
The data used in this project comprises 12-lead ECGs collected from multiple sources, both public and private, around the world. The dataset include more than 8.3 million ECGs measured from both patients in sinus rhythm and patients affected by more than 130 different conditions (sometimes even co-occuring conditions). The list of countries that contributed to the creation of this dataset include:
: China
: Brasil
: Germany
